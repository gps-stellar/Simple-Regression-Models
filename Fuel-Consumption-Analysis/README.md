# üöó Multiple Linear Regression ‚Äî CO2 Emissions Analysis
*By Giovanni Paz-Silva*

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a **multiple linear regression model** using real-world data on vehicle fuel consumption and CO‚ÇÇ emissions. It is part of a machine learning learning path, showcasing the use of Python and Scikit-learn for supervised learning.

## üéØ Objectives
- Use `Scikit-learn` to implement a multiple linear regression model  
- Train and test the model using a fuel consumption dataset  
- Visualize results and interpret coefficients and performance metrics  
- Document each step with clear, beginner-friendly explanations

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used includes **engine size**, **cylinders**, **fuel consumption**, and **CO‚ÇÇ emissions** from various vehicles. It allows us to explore how different vehicle attributes affect CO‚ÇÇ output.

> **Note:** Dataset provided by [Natural Resources Canada](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/7c09c5dc-4fc6-438d-bbfa-a1b2c06ef5f2) or similar educational sources.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process
1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**  
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset using Pandas  
   - Explored correlations between features and CO‚ÇÇ emissions

2. **Modeling**  
   - Built a multiple linear regression model using `Scikit-learn`  
   - Trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on test data  
   - Extracted coefficients and intercepts to explain the model

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Used Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R¬≤ Score  
   - Plotted regression predictions vs. actual CO‚ÇÇ emissions
