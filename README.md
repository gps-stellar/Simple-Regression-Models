## üîç Projects  

### üç¶ Ice-Cream Sales Prediction (Simple Linear Regression)  
- **Goal:** Predict ice-cream sales based on temperature.  
- **Techniques:** Simple Linear Regression.  
- **Key Steps:**  
  - Data visualization of sales vs. temperature.  
  - Model fitting with a regression line.  
  - Evaluation using R¬≤ score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).  
- **Result:** Model showed a strong linear correlation, demonstrating the foundations of regression modeling.

### üåç CO‚ÇÇ Emission Prediction (Multi-Linear Regression)  
- **Goal:** Predict vehicle CO‚ÇÇ emissions based on engine size, cylinders, and fuel consumption.  
- **Techniques:** Multi-Linear Regression.  
- **Key Steps:**  
  - Data cleaning and exploratory analysis.  
  - Feature selection for predictive modeling.  
  - Model evaluation with R¬≤ score and error metrics.  
- **Result:** The model achieved accurate predictions and revealed clear relationships between engine size, fuel consumption, and emissions.

### üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction (Logistic Regression)  
- **Goal:** Predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties.  
- **Techniques:** Logistic Regression (classification framing).  
- **Key Steps:**  
  - Target transformation (good vs. bad wine).  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with correlation and visualization.  
  - Feature scaling, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.  
  - Performance evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **Result:** Logistic Regression achieved strong performance, highlighting alcohol content and acidity as important predictors.
